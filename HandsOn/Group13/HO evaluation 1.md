    Analysis
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
        - In the resource naming strategy, the identifier fragment should not contain the "/" character.
    Ontology
        - In OWL, having multiple domains (or ranges) means that the domain (or range) is the intersection of all the classes.  The current definitions of properties with multiple domains are wrong.
    RDF data
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
