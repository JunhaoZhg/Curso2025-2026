    Analysis
    Ontology
        - The classes in the ontology are not related among them.
    RDF data
        - You don't need to always use """ in strings.
        - The RDF file does not follow the resource naming strategy.
        - The RDF file does not use the class and property URIs defined in the ontology.
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
