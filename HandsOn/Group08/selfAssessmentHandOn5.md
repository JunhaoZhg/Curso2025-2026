## Checklist

**Every RDF file:**

- [X] Has at least one owl:sameAs property that links to another dataset

## Comments on the self-assessment
As discussed in class, we fixed issues with column identification — some columns only had IDs without names. Now the datasets include clear column labels for linking.

We reorganized project folders and files, we put the updated csv and json files in a wrong folder.

We created a new file "extra_info" inside csv, with the datas that specifies the id of our dataset.
