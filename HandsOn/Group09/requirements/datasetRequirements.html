  <h1>Dataset Requirements Analysis</h1>

  <p>This document analyzes whether the selected datasets for the <strong>Museums of Madrid Explorer</strong> application satisfy the defined requirements (R1–R6).</p>

  <h2>Mandatory Requirements (R1–R4)</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Requirement</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Dataset Satisfaction</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>R1</td>
        <td>Data are in one of the selected smart city domains.</td>
        <td>[x] The selected datasets belong to the culture and tourism domain, specifically museum information within the city of Madrid.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>R2</td>
        <td>Data are available as a CSV file.</td>
        <td>[x] The datasets are provided in CSV format, ensuring they can be easily processed and visualized.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>R3</td>
        <td>Data have an open license so they can be published.</td>
        <td>[x] The datasets are released under open licenses from the Madrid Open Data portal, allowing reuse and publication.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>R4</td>
        <td>Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities (e.g., locations).</td>
        <td>[x] The datasets include addresses and geographic coordinates, enabling clear linkage to real museum locations across Madrid.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>Optional Requirements (R5–R6)</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Requirement</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Degree of Satisfaction</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>R5</td>
        <td>Documentation exists for the data.</td>
        <td>Partial: The museum dataset includes basic metadata, but some fields lack detailed descriptions, requiring extra verification.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>R6</td>
        <td>Data can come from multiple data sources.</td>
        <td>Partial: The main dataset comes from the municipal open data portal, though additional cultural datasets (e.g., exhibitions, visitor statistics) could be integrated for richer insights.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The selected datasets fully satisfy the mandatory requirements (R1–R4) for the Museums of Madrid Explorer application. The optional requirements (R5–R6) are partially met, and future additions from other cultural datasets could strengthen completeness and contextual detail.</p>
