    Analysis
        - In the resource naming strategy, the identifier fragment should not contain the "/" character.
    Ontology
        - In OWL, there are object properties (where value of the property is a resource) and datatype properties (where the value of the property is a string literal, usually typed).  Properties are incorrect in the ontology.
        - Some class names are wrong.
    RDF data
        - Classes are encoded wrong.
        - Datatypes are missing.
        - Temporal values are encoded wrong.
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
