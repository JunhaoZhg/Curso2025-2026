    Analysis
    Ontology
        - Sample is not subclass of district.
        - The object properties seem to be wrong.
        - In OWL, having multiple domains (or ranges) means that the domain (or range) is the intersection of all the classes.  The current definitions of properties with multiple ranges are wrong.
    RDF data
        - Stations only have latitude.
        - Date values are not encoded properly.
        - The RDF file does not use the class and property URIs defined in the ontology.
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
